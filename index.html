                <h5>TO CREATE A WEBSITE WITH WORDPRESS, USE ONE-CLICK-INSTALLATION:</h5>
                <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;"> <p>Almost all well-established and reliable web hosting companies have integrated one-click installation for WordPress these days.

          If you chose to sign up with Bluehost or any other similar hosting company, you should find your “one-click installation” either in the account creation process or in your account control panel.

          For example, these are the steps you need to follow to install WordPress on Bluehost (the process is very similar or even the same on all the most popular web hosting companies):</p>
                <p>    Go to Bluehost.com
              - Choose your hosting plan (cheapest plan is fine)
              - If you already have a domain, type it there
              - Fill in your information and choose your hosting length (you can remove the “Extras”).
              - Go through the payment process and create your account
              - Log in to Bluehost use “one-click WordPress install” to Install WordPress</p></div>

                  <h5>Choose a theme</h5>
                <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;"><p>For the next step, we’ll be diving into WordPress themes and how to use and customize them.</p>
                <p>WordPress themes are design templates that make changing your site’s looks a lot quicker and easier.

          Luckily, WordPress has loads of themes to choose from. The official WordPress theme directory alone contains more than 8,000, which are completely free to use.

          You can access themes directly from within WordPress without having to navigate to an external site.

                  For that, simply go to<b> Appearance > Themes, and click the large + sign that says Add New Theme</b>.</p></div>
                
                </section>
             </div>
             <div class="card">
                <section class="main-section" id="add_content">
                <header><h1>Add_Content</h1></header>
                  <code></code>
                <h5>Before getting to site customization, you need to have some content on your site.<br>
          After all, it’s hard to customize your site when there’s nothing on it to show the changes. What you need in terms of content will vary depending on the subject matter of your site and your goals.</h5>
                <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;"><p>However, there are a few key pages that nearly every site has:

              - Homepage
              - About page
              - Contact page

          In deciding which pages to add, consider what information would be most helpful to your visitors. You’ll also need to think about visual content, such as photos.

          To make things easier, some WordPress themes come with page templates for specific page types. Others also come with more than one layout option for each page.</p>
                  <p>To take advantage of these,<b> go to Appearance > Customize.</b>

          In this example, we’re using the latest WordPress default theme, Twenty Twenty-One to create a site. By default, it uses a static page as the homepage that you can configure under Homepage Settings. Use the dropdown menu to select which page you want to serve as your website’s homepage.</p></div>
                
                  <code></code>
                </section>
             </div>
              <div class="card">
                <section class="main-section" id="Well-Organized">
                <header><h1>Well-Organized</h1></header>
                  <code></code>
                <h5>Think of your website as a library.</h5>
                <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;"> <p>Your website structure will become increasingly important the more content you add to your website.</p>

          <p>When learning how to create a website, you need to get expert at organizing your site in a way that makes sense to your visitors and easy for them to get around it.

          A crucial part here is the navigation menu. Once you’ve created some pages, it’s time to make them available to your visitors on the site. You can do that under <b>Appearance > Menus.</b></p></div>
               
                </section>
            </div>
             <div class="card">
                <section class="main-section" id="add_options">
                  <header><h1> Add_Options</h1></header>
                  <code></code>
                <h5>For additional customization options, go back to Appearance > Customize. When you look around, you will see that it offers a lot more options to make changes to your site. You are able to modify other parts of your site like:</h5>
                <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;"><p>    <ol> <li>Title and tagline</li>
                  <li> Colors </li>
                  <li> Typography </li>
                  <li> Background image </li>
                  <li> Menus </li>
                  <li> Widgets </li>
                  </ol>
          You can also make adjustments to your homepage, blog page, and add custom code. The options that appear will vary depending on which theme you’ve installed.

          Customizing WordPress Theme.
                  To install new plugins, navigate to <b>Plugins > Add New</b></p></div>
                  
                </section>
             </div> 
             <div class="card">
                <section class="main-section" id="add_blog">
                <header><h1>Add_Blog</h1></header>
                  <code></code>
                <h5>Not every website needs a blog. However, creating one can be a good idea to regularly publish fresh content, display your expertise, and provide additional value for your visitors.</h5>
                <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;"><p>To add a blog in WordPress, you first have to select a blog page. Above, I have already covered that you can configure your homepage to automatically display your latest posts. However, if you want a dedicated blog page instead and keep your homepage static, you first need to create it.</p>

          <p>This is as simple as setting up an empty page (Pages > Add New), naming it Blog (or whatever you want but Blog makes sense because it will automatically create the address yoursite.com/blog for your blog page), and publishing it. Then, pick it as your Posts Page either under <b>Appearance > Customize > Homepage Settings or under Settings > Reading.</b></p></div>
